ColorFlow 4 API
======

This API is limited - please contact me if you wish to add ColorFlow 4 support to your tweak but are unsure where to start or have any questions. Note that it's almost identical to the previous ColorFlow tweak APIs.

#### What does _your_ tweak do?
* **Modify Lock Screen:** If you add/modify lock screen controls, you should check out the Lock Screen API. It will allow you to color your controls in sync with ColorFlow 4 via notifications.
* **Modify Music app:** If you add/modify controls in the Music app's now playing view, you should check out the Music app API. It will also allow you to color your controls in sync with ColorFlow 4 via notifications.
* **Modify Spotify app:** ColorFlow doesn't have an official Spotify API. If you're interested in supporting ColorFlow, please email me.
* **Add/modify media views in SpringBoard:** You may be able to use the SpringBoard API in order to have ColorFlow 4 analyze album artwork and give you the dominant colors. Please contact me if you plan on using this API, as it may be possible to reuse some of ColorFlow 4's code to color your views.
